# Branding

Guidelines for a consistent look in all parts of the project.

The following section will describe the guidelines we ask to be enforced when designing media for or about the Crystal Linux distribution. You are under no legal obligation to follow these rules, but following them will result in a cleaner, more consistent look, in line with what we are making for official media.

## üí¨ Naming

We ask to be referred to as `Project Shards` or `Shards` (Do not mention `GNU` in the name)

 `Projects Shards Linux distribution` is also applicable in situations where `Shards` or `Project Shards` would be too broad or confusing of a term.

## üñºÔ∏è Use of Logo

We ask for the Shards logo to only be used when relating to Project Shards. The logo should not be used in the context of another Linux distribution, Linux as a whole, nor any unrelated ideas/purposes.

## üåà Colours

We ask for the following colours to be used for any media on/about Shards or in relation to it: 

###  Logo

- `#8839EF`
- `#FFFFFF`
 
###  Colour Scheme

We are currently working on a full colour scheme for Shards! [Feel free to contribute here](colours.md)!

## üìò Fonts

Typically, for official graphics we prefer to use [Atkinson Hyperlegible ](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible). 

## üñ•Ô∏è Apps 

We kindly ask that with any commits to our homemade apps you follow the GNOME HIG (https://developer.gnome.org/hig/) (https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/HIG) as we're trying to create a unified experience with GTK4 and libadwaita.

## Resources 

All of our app designs base on the GNOME HIG, here are some links

## üì¢ Promotional/Media

For graphics like banners and other promotional material, we prefer to use our logo in the white variant, paired with the [Atkinson Hyperlegible ](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible) font.
